      <h1> Where it all began </h1>
      <center><img src = "subway9.jpg" class = "imgframe"></center>
      <p> It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1000, and a business relationship was forged that would change the landscape of the fast food industry and the lives of thousands.The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. By 1974, the duo owned and operated 16 submarine sandwich shops throughout Connecticut. Realizing they would not reach their 32 store goal in time, they began franchising, launching the SUBWAY® brand into a period of remarkable growth which continues to this day.</p>
